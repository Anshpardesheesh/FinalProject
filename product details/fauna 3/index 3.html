                    </div>
                    <p>A hexapede (Na'vi name: yerik) is a land herbivore that resides in various biomes of Pandora, including rainforests, savanna, subarctic tundra, and mountainous regions. Hexapedes are some of the most beautiful and fragile creatures of Pandora. Although a prime target for any land or aerial predator, the rapid pace of their breeding keeps them from extinction. The hexapede is a food source for the Na'vi, and is one of the prime targets for Na'vi hunters. Swarms of stingbats also occasionally attack them.</p>
                    <p>The hexapede resembles a six-legged Terran gazelle or antelope. They are dark blue herbivores with white and yellow stripes. Their eyes are wide-spaced and large, and they have sloped snouts that end in a small bifurcating jaw and bifurcated lip that can be retracted. A skin membrane "beard" hangs under the jaw and runs the length of the neck.</p>
                    <p>These docile creatures appear to have little hostility either among their own herd or in the presence of a predator. They are only moderately fast runners, although they can weave, bob and turn with the best prey. The latter helps them survive in the grasslands, but when they venture into the forest for the food they crave (including tree bark and various leaves and berries) this strategy has less effectiveness, since they have less maneuvering room.</p>
