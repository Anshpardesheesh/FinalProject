                  <p class="text">The Palulukan, (known as Thanators by humanity), are massive predators that inhabit <br>in the rainforests of the jungle moon of Pandora (mainly on the Valley of the Thanators). <br>Their Na'vi name means "dry mouth bringer of fear".</p>
                  <p>The Thanator has ten sensory quills that sprout from sections of armor plating that encircle the <br>rear of its skull. The function of the quills is still a mystery, but it has been hypothesized <br>that they may be tied to an internal mechanism of prey location. The quills also flare <br>up to produce a more menacing appearance.
                  <p>It also has an armored neck and back, a massive distensible jaw, and twenty-three centimeter long <br>sharp teeth. The Thanator has burnished black skin. Its ten external sensory quills are colored <br>red and yellow. The upper lip folds back for maximum tooth extension. The Na'vi, who are <br>around 9 to 10 feet tall, could ride>on the back of one of these beasts, making <br>them approximately 20 feet long.
                  <p>The Thanator appears to hunt alone, and normally does not stray outside of its territory, which is <br>believed to be roughly 300 square kilometers. It appears to hunt mainly at night, although seems <br>to make an exception if hungry enough.
