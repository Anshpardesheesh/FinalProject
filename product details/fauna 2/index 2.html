                    <p>The hammerhead titanothere has poor distance vision, but makes up for this with acute hearing and <br>an excellent sense of smell. Although massive, its six limbs allow it to pivot rapidly when it detects <br>a threat from the side or rear. The animal's overlapping body plates and large, bony shoulder and back <br>offer protection during battles with other titanotheres or large creatures such as the leonopteryx or thanator. Their armor, however, only covers the front of their bodies. Their hindquarters are relatively <br>unprotected. The titanothere has a genetic similarity to the hexapede: It has very small feathery scent organs on the side of the neck. It has four eyes and a soft, ungulate mouth, protected by a beak-like jaw structure.</p>
                    <p>Hammerhead titanotheres group together when attacked by a thanator or leonopteryx, which are their only known predators. Many titanotheres charging at a perceived threat is even more intimidating than a single angry titanothere.

                      Fighting males will attempt to injure their opponents' eyes with the knobs at the ends of their hammers. The titanothere is highly territorial. Alpha males use their considerable momentum to spread their scent by smashing trees, thus warning other animals (including other titanothere bulls) to steer clear.</p>
