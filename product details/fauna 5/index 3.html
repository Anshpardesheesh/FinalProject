                    <p>These seeds, according to the Na'vi, are very pure and sacred spirits. Furthermore, these seeds are believed to be auspicious wheresoever they choose to rest. They are similar in appearance to small deep-sea jellyfish, but they float on the wind like dandelion seeds, possibly aided in this by the denser atmosphere on Pandora. Woodsprites also hold ritual importance. The Omaticaya clan plants one of these seeds with the body of a deceased Na'vi, so the Na'vi's consciousness will become part of Eywa.</p>
                    <p>In Avatar, a woodsprite lands on the tip of Neytiri's arrow moments before she is about to kill Jake Sully using her bow. Later, many woodsprites lay on Jake, resulting in Neytiri taking him to the clan's Hometree because she interpreted this event as a sign from Eywa.</p>
